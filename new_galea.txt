3 groups
asymptote when hit the same location several times
error-clamp set cursor position to the target center and reward regardless of
movement

NA, BE+VE, BE (no asymptote, both types of errors and only binary error)

NA group protocol
baseline, 45 rotation with which feedback?, error clamp washout

BE+VE
baseline, 30 deg rotation, asympt, 45 rotation, error clamp, washout

BE
baseline, 30 deg rotation, asympt (here and only here BE recives
binary feedback), 45 rotation, error clamp, washout
 
Not sure our model with sequential connection between CB and BG it can work this
way

I am not even sure mathematics can really adapt
